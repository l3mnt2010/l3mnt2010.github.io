# WEB challs


## InsoBank

- **Title : NextJs, Python, MySql, postgresSql, smart from u :3**

- The web application in this challenge is a banking app that supports transferring deposits from one account to another. However, all the accounts involved in a transfer operation must belong to the same person; this means we cannot transfer money from our account to other peopleâ€™s accounts.

- You must register with new account and login with your account

- You only can transfer for 2 account provide by sever
- This is UI transfer

- To have flag FLAG = os.getenv("FLAG") or 'INS{fake-flag}'
- Your acoount must have 1 account have balance > 13.37.

```
 for (accountid,name,balance) in cursor.fetchall():
        if balance > 13.37:
            results[accountid] = {'name': name, 'balance': balance, 'flag': FLAG}
        else:
            results[accountid] = {'name': name, 'balance': balance}
    conn.close()
    return jsonify(results)

    userid = get_jwt_identity()
    batchid = str(uuid.uuid4())
    senderid = request.json.get("senderid")

- This code effective touch a new batch for tranfer.

- will first check the user's jwt, then check if the amount the user sent is greater than 0 or not.
- then it will select the total number of records with unverified transaction from mysql , Then it will check the batch id, user id and see if the verified attribute is false or not (which means the transaction has not been committed) . If batch id does not exist, user id is not equal to our id, an error will be returned.
- Then it will check if 1 id (there are 3 ids for each recipient, like 1 account with 3 wallets) received the money twice or not. If so, an error will also be returned. The next part will take our balance and add information to both the MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.



### After a thorough code review, here are the vulnerabilities that we can exploit:

- **Discrepancies in Data Precision:**

- In the MySQL database, the data type of amount is decimal(10,2), while in the PostgreSQL database, it is just decimal. This causes a floating-point number like 0.014 to be stored in MySQL as 0.01, but as 0.014 in PostgreSQL.

- We can see excec_transfer will be excute every 1 minute by sh

Flow exec :
- This section will check for transactions that have not yet been executed and have been verified to perform the money transfer, then repeat a number of times equal to the total number of records, then each iteration finds the number of similar records and repeats with the number of records. selected, set excuted = true for both mysql and pgsql tables to confirm excuted this time, then assign again TRANSFERS[recipient] = amount if recipient not in TRANSFERS.keys() else TRANSFERS[recipient] + amount, continue looping with the number of elements of TRANSFER then add balance to the value of TRANSFERS[recipient] , so This will be an important part to get the FLAG.

- The logic flaw arises here. The amount to deduct is based on decimal(10,2), while the amount to increase is based on decimal. When two transactions with the same batch_id are processed at once, an extra $0.01 gets smuggled into the recipientâ€™s account.

- For example, if two transactions are each transferring $0.014 from saving to checking account, the senderâ€™s account gets deducted by $0.02, but the recipientâ€™s account gets increased by $0.028, which rounds up to $0.03.

- There are many ways to solve it : race or take advantage of differences.
- Sending a request for the amount 09.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 may cause MySQL to return an error, but not PostgreSQL.
